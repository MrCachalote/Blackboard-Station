        <p> 
            The main objective of this research is to define the concept of gamification and explain how to effectively implement it in education by following a five-step process, which is demonstrated through five study cases. Finally, the authors conclude that gamification of education may be a great strategy provided a correct implementation, following some crucial concepts. Thus, learning objectives can be met in lower amounts of time compared to traditional methods. The importance of motivation in the learning process is strongly emphasized.  <br><br>

            This article results quite suitable for the present research since it offers a definition of gamification and assesses the implementation of this technique in different educational contexts. Regarding the reliability of the source, the paper meets this standard for it emanates from the University of Toronto. <br><br>

            This article presents how versatile gamification is, being applicable to a wide variety of fields, including education. Even within this last area, we still observe that it is relevant to nearly all educational levels and contexts. Since it begins offering a definition of the term gamification, we can compare or contrast it with others present in other works from our bibliography. Thus, this document can serve as a source for the theoretical framework. <br><br>

        <h2 id="section3"> Gamification in Education: What, How, Why Bother (Lee & Hammer) </h2>
        <p>
            In a context of a society increasingly reliant on electronic devices and the Internet, the authors aim to explain the usefulness of gamification in schools, as a way of approaching the everlasting issue of students’ engagement and motivation. They start posing a definition of gamification of education, and in which ways it may improve students’ school experience. Then, the authors talk about goals and techniques to implement in the classroom which, according to their approach, can impact over three areas, namely: cognitive, emotional, and social. Finally, they discuss the benefits this technique can offer but also the risks that a wrong implementation can report. <br><br>
            Considering this, the present article shows being reliable, since approaches both benefits and possible drawbacks of gamification of education. <br><br>
            Although short, this paper provides accurate definitions and well-supported implementation suggestions and warns. Indeed, it can be easily related to similar works by means or contrast or comparison. <br><br>

        <h2 id="section4"> No Pain, no Gain? Investigating Motivational Mechanisms of Game Elements in Cognitive Tasks (Bernecker & Nisaus) </h2>
        <p>
            This research study focuses on the influence of game elements on learning and performance in cognitive tasks. The article questions, through two studies, the view that the participants performing gamified tasks would successfully perform them; whereas, participants performing non-gamified tasks would experience a motivational and positive effect with an objective effort. The evidence indicates that the integration of game elements into cognitive tasks prevents task disengagement, but it does not necessarily improve task performance. For this reason, people can be motivated to stay engaged by using game elements in cognitive tasks. <br><br>
            The evidence provided by this article is effective for the present research because it reflects the main idea, which is gamification's influence on motivation and engagement in the classroom. This thorough article describes objectively the methods of the two studies; therefore, it offers reliability to the readers who are interested in this field. The results showed not only present the participants who experienced gamified tasks, but also participants with non-gamified tasks. Consequently, it is possible to appreciate the different sides considered in the study. <br><br>

        <h2 id="section5"> Educational Gamification Vs. Game Based Learning: Comparative Study (R. Al Azawi et al) </h2>
        <p>
            This report provides an overview of the difference between gamification and game-based learning (GBL). The authors define the terms targeted in the study in order to compare and analyze them in many compromising categories. As a conclusion, this paper clarifies the importance of using new trends in education due to their advantages in regards to increased learning. <br><br>
            Even though the authors do not provide full research with studies, they help readers with the information collected in order to have an organized comparative analysis table. In other words, readers will be able to choose the appropriate concept to apply it according to their context. Nevertheless, it might not be useful for a person who wants to see the results between gamification and GBL, nor what would be the best choice in a classroom between them. <br><br>
            The information provided here is useful in addressing the general aspects of gamification, such as its definition and the difference it holds with GBL. This way, this serves as an explanation of the purpose of each approach, avoiding the confusion between them at the moment of analyzing models present in other works.<br><br>

        <h2 id="section6"> Game On! Perceptions of Gamified Learning (Buckley et al) </h2>
        <p>            
            The purpose of the article is to show a study on the perceptions of a gamified learning through interventions deployed in two university modules in Ireland. The authors focus on an explanatory approach to collect the information; therefore, the study resides in students’ perspective towards a gamified learning environment. The results suggest that the effectiveness in motivation and engagement may change depending on several factors, i.e. class size, level of education, and learning style; however, the method improved outcomes for all learners. <br><br>

            Even though it is a research deployed in the field of economics, it is a useful source for the topic to be developed. This is because it qualitatively evaluates the effectiveness of motivation and engagement in well-implemented gamified activities in education. The information is appropriate given that this research has reliable sources, and the methodology to collect information provides a better understanding of the effectiveness of the approach. <br><br>

            This article shows that gamification has an impact on students’ motivation and engagement towards the learning outcomes set in the program. In addition, it demonstrates how versatile gamification is when applied properly in context, which would boost learning goals and improve the perception of students towards contents. <br><br>

        <h2 id="section7"> From Storytelling to Storylearning: How to Motivate Multimedia Design Students [Original Title: Del Storytelling al Storylearning. Cómo Motivar a los Alumnos de Guión y Diseño Multimedia] (Leguerén) </h2>
        <p>
            In this article, the author explains how to design and implement university courses by using principles of gamification of education. Specifically, she narrates the experience of implementing techniques of storytelling in the teaching of classes such as design and development of video games, design and management of audiovisual and interactive projects, etc. Although the methodical explanations, the writer highlights the importance of fun and motivation in the learning process.<br><br>
            This work adequately utilizes jargon related to gamification, for example, by labeling students as players and structuring the academic activities in a game-like manner, evidencing the knowledge of the writer about the topic. In-text references to other authors are frequent. Also, this article is part of a journal published by Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.<br><br>
            Despite this field differs from English education, the core elements of the method presented are easily adaptive to some, yet very widespread, approaches of English teaching. For instance, the communicative approach mentioned in the present article resembles that used in the English classroom in which students can develop and hone linguistics skills as well as their creativity. Furthermore, there are indications to design not only activities, but complete courses.<br><br>

        <h2 id="section8"> The Shift to Gamification in Education: A Review on Dominant Issues (Ofosu-Ampong) </h2>
        <p>
            This research paper analyzes 32 articles related to gamification in education from 2011 to 2018. The research question in this review is how learning has been performed in the development, application, and impact of gamification in education. Findings in this study evaluate the dominant issues to generate knowledge on the study of gamification in education has progressed in the gamified learning environments. To conclude, the study emphasizes a progression over time and suggests some design guidelines for future gamified systems.<br><br>
            Having considered all these elements, this article fits in our research because it has collected data from almost a decade; therefore, it is possible to examine nowadays whether gamification is useful in education or not. The authors consider three steps that teachers usually do when doing classes: develop, apply, and check the impact on students. Analyzing the student’s perspective is crucial for teachers since they can evaluate students’ learning outcomes and motivation. <br><br>

        <h2 id="section9"> Does educational gamification improve students’ motivation? If so, which game elements work best? (Chapman & Rich)</h2>
        <p>
            The main point of this study is to demonstrate how the implementation of gamification to a university business course may increase motivation in students. The research questions are “To what degree does educational gamification and specific game elements increase students’ perceived motivation in learning?” and “Are the benefits of gamification limited to or enhanced in participants with specific demographic characteristics?”. The results report that more than a half of the participants indicate that the gamified course is more motivating than a traditional course. <br><br>

            This study was performed using an empirical collecting data mechanism. This article shows that by effectively applying gamification to the educational context, there is an increase in motivation, which appears to be a useful source. Although the study took a part in a university business course, there are core elements that can be adapted to English teaching approaches.<br><br>

            Despite the fact that there is a dearth of studies in the area, this research shows that lastly in the field of education, gamification has become a revolutionary approach, from which English teaching can take advantage of. Trying these new methodologies would increase motivation in learning ESL, so the information presented here would serve as a theoretical support as well as pragmatic indications.<br><br>
