  <h1>Needs Analysis Report</h1>
  


        <p>
            This report aims to explain the context of a high school English class under online modality as well as identifying a specific educational need of such group. That need will be determined by reviewing academic sources related to the fields of education and linguistics and considering the characteristics of the students. <br><br>

            As to relate the present situation with academic educational theory, Vygotsky (1930) argues that the zone of proximal development is possible due to the socialization between teacher (“more knowledgeable other”) and learner, which is still extremely relevant in the current online modality. Similarly, Hymes (1972) suggests that elements such as social knowledge and cultural background of the learners have a great impact on the process of developing linguistic skills, so those factors can be used at the moment of introducing them new content. To illustrate, students could develop strategic competence to communicate in the class when a communication  breakdown occurs. Considering this, it would be convenient and contingent to use technological devices and apps in order to encourage the development of strategic communicative competences. Furthermore, the use of minimal responses may ease the establishment of a fluid communication. Consequently, teachers can have certain security that students are following their activities. Along with this, the use of video conference software that feature tools to express agreement or general feelings is crucial. <br><br>

            It is also crucial to understand that the issue arises in the context of the new online modality. In other words, students do not participate since they feel not obligated to do so, while others simply cannot attend classes. Thus, students’ attitude towards the language seems to be negative in this specific case since it is impossible to determine if that has always been the case. Furthermore, students (again, at least the ones attending classes) seem not to be intrinsically motivated to learn English in this online modality. Likewise, it is important to mention that the learning skill cannot be extracted straightforwardly. Therefore, we can attempt to infer the learning need in question. Consequently, it is probably a problem regarding speaking as they may not want to participate for being afraid of making mistakes in front of the online class. More specifically, the sub-skill identified in this case would correspond to interactive strategies. As argued by Doff & Thaine (2014), these strategies are small chunks of language that allow speakers to do something in a conversation or a discussion. By the same token, we believe that students lack these strategies; thus, students cannot interact orally with other peers and the teacher in the online classroom. With regards to the prioritized curriculum, it is declared that the objective related to these sub-skills are the following ones: <br><br>

            Comunicación oral: <br><br>

            OA8: “Demostrar conocimiento y uso del lenguaje en conversaciones, discusiones y exposiciones por medio de las siguientes funciones:<br><br>
                • Expresarse con claridad usando palabras y expresiones de uso común, sinónimos, palabras compuestas, por ejemplo: sorry about…<br>
                • Expresar acuerdo o desacuerdo, por ejemplo: I disagree with...”<br><br>

            1. Learning Needs:<br><br>

            Describe the learning need identified, clearly establishing the point to be supported according to language skills and sub-skills. Refer to the relationship between the need and the prioritised national curriculum for the level assigned, and the elements presented in the case that guided your inference. Consider the literature in ELT available to support the relevance of the need identified.<br><br>

            • The learning need “identified”: It can be inferred that it is related to Speaking (productive skill). More specifically, the sub-skill identified is the use of interactive strategies.<br><br>

            • Level of English: No information provided; however, probably their level of English corresponds to a pre-intermediate level (A1).<br><br>

            • Attitude toward English: They behave respectfully in classes. Nevertheless, they apparently demonstrate slight interest in the English class.<br><br>

            • Pedagogies: It is not specified how the teacher works with the students. However, it is claimed that, recently, students have only been assessed summatively.<br><br>

            • Exposure & interaction opportunities: Students have only 40 minutes of English per week and do not interact much during the session.<br><br>

            • Materials Used: Not specified. It is only mentioned that students can print materials every 15 days; however, it is not stated the type of materials.<br><br>

            • Language skills developed: Not specified.<br><br>
